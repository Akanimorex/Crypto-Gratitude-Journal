# Crypto Gratitude Journal

**Crypto Gratitude Journal** is a decentralized application (dApp) where users can write and store daily gratitude notes on the blockchain. The platform tracks users' gratitude streaks and allows them to view their past entries. Users can also mint their best entries as NFTs to preserve special moments of gratitude forever.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: ReactJS, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Scroll
- **Wallet Interaction**: Ethers.js, Web3Modal
- **Alchemy RPC**: Used to connect and interact with the Scroll chain.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A wallet like MetaMask to connect to the dApp.
- Alchemy API key for Scroll RPC.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akanimorex/Crypto-Gratitude-Journal.git
   cd crypto-gratitude-journal
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your **Alchemy API key**.

   ```bash
   REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_API_URL=https://scroll.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key
   ```

## Contract Deployment

1. Deploy the Solidity smart contract to the Scroll testnet using Hardhat, Remix, or your preferred tool.
2. Replace the contract address in `src/App.tsx`:

   ```typescript
   const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS';
   ```

3. Ensure you have the correct **Alchemy RPC URL** for Scroll configured in your smart contract deployment configuration (such as `hardhat.config.js`).

## Running the Frontend

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open the dApp in your browser:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. Connect your MetaMask wallet and start writing gratitude notes!
